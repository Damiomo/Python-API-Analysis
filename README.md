## Description
In order to prove that temperature gets hotter as we get closer to de equator, I collected current weather conditions from over 500 random cities around the world. We did this with the use of OpenWeatherMap API.  Then, I evaluated temperature, cloudiness, humidity and wind speed.  On part two of this project, I filter cities with ideal weather conditions and used I used the Places API from Geoapify.
